I added one new file "js/filter.js" and made changes in the existing file "index.html". 

**Changes in index.html

1. Added jquery for autocomplete feature. 

  <!--jquery-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css">  
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js"></script>  
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>

2. Added one div tag which will be used to provide the filter options by domain name and distance (1 to 5).

3. Transfer the logic of graph plotting to another file. (filter.js)

**Description of filter.js

1. Created two data structure Queue and Graph.

   Queue : Data Structure follows FIFO (first in first out) rule. Use in traversing
   the graph in level order or BFS (Breadth First Search).

   Graph : Data Structure use to create adjacency list and instead loading
   Json file everytime, it will load it once and store whole data into that graph 
   data structure and that data structure will be used to solve further queries.

2. Added Implementation of BFS.
